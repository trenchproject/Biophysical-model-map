# RShiny_BiophysicalModelMap

R shiny interactive visualization of lizards, grasshoppers, butterflies, snails, mussels and salamandars biophysical models.
The application investigates the change in operative temperatures in 2050, 2070 and 2090 in the United States. For future temperatures, we use CMIP5 multimodel ensemble with RCP2.6, RCP6.0 and RCP8.5 projections, which are considered as optimistic, intermediate and pessimistic scenarios, respectively.
We use gridMET to obtain current weather data, and add certain degrees of anomaly, which represent the difference in temperatures between this year and the future years.
