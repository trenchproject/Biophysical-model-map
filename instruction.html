<h3>How to use the app</h3>
The map displays the operative temperature of organisms across the United States. 
<br>
1. Select an animal from the "Species" section and set the variables that show up on the bottom. Critical thermal maximum is an optional variable, and enabling it will color the areas in red where the operative temperature excedeeds the critical thermal maximum.
<br>
2. Select a nowcast or a forecast to map the operative temperature of animals in the "See temperature for..." section. Upon selecting a forecast for this week, you can further specify which day and time you want to see, and for future forecasts, you can choose one of the three scenarios to simulate the predicted temperatures.
<br>
3. On the top-right corner of the map, you have an option to show the air temperature under equivalent conditions to compare the difference in operative and environmental temperatures. 
4. Changing the scale from "Discrete" to "Continuous" right above the map provides more detailed temperature distribution but disables the coloring of critical thermal maximum.
